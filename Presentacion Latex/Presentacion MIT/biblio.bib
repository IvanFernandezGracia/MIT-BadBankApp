abstract = "In this paper we present a stabilized finite element formulation to solve the Oseen equations as a model problem involving both convection effects and the incompressibility restriction. The need for stabilization techniques to solve this problem arises because of the restriction in the possible choices for the velocity and pressure spaces dictated by the inf–sup condition, as well as the instabilities encountered when convection is dominant. Both can be overcome by resorting from the standard Galerkin method to a stabilized formulation. The one presented here is based on the subgrid scale concept, in which unresolvable scales of the continuous solution are approximately accounted for. In particular, the approach developed herein is based on the assumption that unresolved subscales are orthogonal to the finite element space. It is shown that this formulation is stable and optimally convergent for an adequate choice of the algorithmic parameters on which the method depends."

The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods. The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100."

The stabilized method is based on the algebraic version of the sub-grid scale approach. We first describe this technique for general systems of convection–diffusion–reaction equations and then we apply it to the linearized flow equations. The important point is the design of the matrix of stabilization parameters that the method has. This design is based on the identification of the stability problems of the Galerkin method and a scaling of variables argument to determine which coefficients must be included in the stabilization matrix. This, together with the convergence analysis of the linearized problem, leads to a simple expression for the stabilization parameters in the general situation considered in the paper. The numerical analysis of the linearized problem also shows that the method has optimal convergence properties."

We consider VMS models obtained by different subgrid scale approximations which include either static or dynamic subscales, linear or nonlinear multiscale splitting, and different choices of the subscale space. After a brief review of these models, we discuss some implementation aspects particularly relevant to the simulation of turbulent flows, namely the use of a skew symmetric form of the convective term and the computation of projections when orthogonal subscales are used. We analyze the energy conservation (and numerical dissipation) of the alternative VMS formulations, which is numerically evaluated. In the numerical study, we have considered three well known problems: the decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, the Taylor–Green vortex problem and the turbulent flow in a channel. We compare the results obtained using different VMS models, paying special attention to the effect of using orthogonal subscale spaces. The VMS results are also compared against classical LES scheme based on filtering and the dynamic Smagorinsky closure. Altogether, our results show the tremendous potential of VMS for the numerical simulation of turbulence. Further, we study the sensitivity of VMS to the algorithmic constants and analyze the behavior in the small time step limit. We have also carried out a computational cost comparison of the different formulations. Out of these experiments, we can state that the numerical results obtained with the different VMS formulations (as far as they converge) are quite similar. However, some choices are prone to instabilities and the results obtained in terms of computational cost are certainly different. The dynamic orthogonal subscales model turns out to be best in terms of efficiency and robustness."

  abstract = {An approach is developed for deriving variational methods capable of representing multiscale phenomena. The ideas are first illustrated on the exterior problem for the Helmholtz equation. This leads to the well-known Dirichlet-to-Neumann formulation. Next, a class of subgrid scale models is developed and the relationships to ‘bubble function’ methods and stabilized methods are established. It is shown that both the latter methods are approximate subgrid scale models. The identification for stabilized methods leads to an analytical formula for τ, the ‘intrinsic time scale’, whose origins have been a mystery heretofore.},
